# Proposal of discounts with filters adapted to different profiles

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The Idea of the algorithm is to propose to the user when looking for purchases, only purchases corresponding to profiles found in the dataset. This way, the user doesn't have to apply filters systematically and the ads proposed only correspond to purchases, the user is susceptible to make.



## Background

This will help avoid loosing time when clicking on an ad, the user is not eligible for or he doesn't fit with the characteristics. 


## How is it used?

It can be used for personal or professional use.

## Data sources and AI methods
The data will be collected by keeping in memory the different research the user is making and building a profile of information from those researches.
2 possibilities : 
  - This algorithm will use unsupervised learning to create profiles if the profiles are not registered by the user and also supervised learning to propose the suitable purchases.
  - This algorithm will only use the supervised learning part as the profiles are already registered by the user.
    
## Challenges

The issue is that it uses personal data. It has to request the approval of the user for such purpose which is not likely in the aim to respect data regulations .
